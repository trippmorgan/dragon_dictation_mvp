# Dragon-like Dictation Pro (GUI Edition)

A local, private, and intelligent medical dictation assistant designed to streamline clinical documentation. This application provides a dedicated graphical user interface (GUI) for dictating, editing, and managing structured medical reports. It uses `faster-whisper` for high-accuracy, offline speech recognition and features a powerful macro and slot-filling system based on your own templates.

## ‚ú® Core Features

-   **üñ•Ô∏è Dedicated GUI:** A clean, persistent window serves as a "staging area" for your dictations. No more terminal clutter.
-   **‚èØÔ∏è Toggle-to-Record:** Simply press the **`r`** key anywhere on your system to start or stop recording. No need to hold down a key.
-   **üîë Smart Macros:** Say **`insert <procedure>`** (e.g., `insert shuntogram`) to instantly load a complete, structured report template from `config/macros.json`.
-   **üß© Voice Slot-Filling:** After loading a macro, fill placeholders by saying **`set <field> to <value>`** (e.g., `set artery to superficial femoral`).
-   **üìã One-Click Copy:** A "Copy to Clipboard" button lets you easily transfer your finalized note to your EMR or any other application.
-   **üé® Live Status Bar:** The GUI provides real-time feedback on the app's status: `Idle`, `Recording...`, or `Transcribing...`.
-   **üîí 100% Local & Private:** All audio processing and transcription happens on your machine. No data is ever sent to the cloud, ensuring patient privacy.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup (with Conda)

1.  **Create Conda Environment:**
    If you haven't already, create a dedicated environment.
    ```bash
    conda create -n dragon_dictation python=3.10 -y
    conda activate dragon_dictation
    ```

2.  **Install PyTorch:**
    Choose the command that matches your hardware.
    ```bash
    # For CPU-only systems (including Apple Silicon Macs)
    conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cpuonly -c pytorch -y

    # For NVIDIA GPUs (CUDA 12.1 example)
    conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia -y
    ```

3.  **Install App Dependencies:**
    Navigate to the project folder and run:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *Note: On some Linux systems, you may need to install the Tkinter library if it's not included with Python: `sudo apt-get install python3-tk`.*


## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1.  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
2.  Run the script:
    ```bash
    python dragon_mvp.py --model small.en
    ```
3.  A GUI window titled "Medical Dictation Assistant" will appear. You can minimize your terminal.

##  workflow in action

1.  The GUI window is open. You can work in any other application (EMR, web browser, etc.).
2.  Press the **`r`** key to start recording. The status bar will turn red.
3.  Dictate your command or text. For example: `insert bilateral arteriogram`.
4.  Press **`r`** again to stop. The status bar will turn orange (`Transcribing...`) and then the template will appear in the GUI window.
5.  Press **`r`**, dictate `set indication to rest pain`, and press **`r`** again. The `{indication}` placeholder in the window will be filled.
6.  Continue this process until the note is complete.
7.  Click the **"Copy to Clipboard"** button in the GUI.
8.  Click into your EMR and paste (`Cmd+V` or `Ctrl+V`).
